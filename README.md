## About This Project

This repository is a community-provided example for creating custom animal entities in Minecraft Legends. It is maintained by the [Legends Modding](https://github.com/LegendsModding) organization and serves as a starting point for modders who want to add new creatures to the game.

This example includes:
*   A custom animal entity, the "Crocapus".
*   Behavior and resource packs (`BP` and `RP`) for the entity.
*   Natural spawning in the frostlands when the "roaming animals" game rule is enabled.

## Getting Started

To use this example as a template for your own mod:

1.  **Fork or clone this repository.**
2.  **Explore the `legends_example_animal_bp` and `legends_example_animal_rp` directories.**
    *   `bp/`: Contains the behavior pack, defining the entity's logic and behaviors.
    *   `rp/`: Contains the resource pack, defining textures, models, sounds, and UI elements.
3.  **Modify the files to create your own custom animal.**
    *   Rename files and update identifiers to match your new entity.
    *   Replace models, textures, and animations with your own assets.
    *   Adjust the entity's behavior in the `.json` files.
